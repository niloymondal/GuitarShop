    <h4 class="card-title"> <strong>Les Paul Conversions</strong></h4>
    <p class="card-text">These guitars started out as an early 1950s Gibson Les Paul Junior or Les Paul Special, 
      but why convert them? There are only around 1500 Bursts but there are over 10,000 Juniors and Specials 
      from the same era. Many of these Juniors and Specials were not treated well, and even more were abused. 
      We buy guitars that, as they are, are not worth restoring. They’ve been modified with screwdrivers substituting 
      for chisels and are often painted hideous colors, like Signal Orange. To restore them to what 
      they were is just not feasible. We’ve worked on numerous real Bursts since 1962.</p>
